# Fobby
~~The CoilSnake GUI~~
GUI Generator for YAMLs.

# Readme is still a WIP, sorry lel :P

## What was Fobby?
The original Fobby emerged out of the Earthbound/Mother 2 hacking community on Starmen.net. 

For years the go to tool for modifying Earthbound Rom's had been PK Hack otherwise known as JHack, which although still a very thorough tool suffered from the problem of being increasingly slow (mainly due to rellying on tools and libraries which were pretty outdated, and not really being maintained or updated at all since who known when). 

Eventually user by the name of Mr. Tenda decided to make his own tool called [CoilSnake](http://mrtenda.github.io/CoilSnake/), which was meant to modernize things so to say. This however came at the cost of going from a single massive GUI application to a small bare-bones interface which would split all of the data into manually editable YAML files and images. 

In hopes of finding the best of both worlds, I decided to make my own UI *for* CoilSnake which could read and write YAMLs. Due  to mostly unfortunate circumstances I found myself abandoning the project quiet some time ago. 

## What is Fobby now?
It's a work in progress. The original Fobby was just me hard-coding UI to match the format of the YAMLs. For example if I wanted to allow users to add new enemies to the game; I would need to design a UI of my own, and match that to the appropriate YAML file. Seeing how tedious this was I started contemplating if there could be a better way of doing this...

(Todo: tell of the experiment that was Fobby 0.75)
